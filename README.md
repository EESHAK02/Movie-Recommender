# Movie-Recommender

This is a movie recommender system built using Streamlit and Sentence Transformer. You can add a short description of what you feel like watching and the app will suggest the best possible movies based on the filters you choose like post which year do you prefer, or if you have a specific minimum rating in mind!

### What's fun? 
If you are in the mood to just play around and watch something you just want to judge critically, you have the option to choose 'Bottom 5' and instead of the usual top 5 movies it will recommend the last choices based on what you want to watch!
